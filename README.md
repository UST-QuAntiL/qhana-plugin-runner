This package uses Poetry ([documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)).

Original template repository: <https://github.com/buehlefs/flask-template/>

> This repository also contains a Dockerfile and has pre-built docker containers available as GitHub packages.
> Please see the [Docker](#docker) section for more information.

## VSCode

For vscode install the python extension and add the poetry venv path to the folders the python extension searches for venvs.

On linux:

```json
{
    "python.venvFolders": [
        "~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs"
    ]
}
```

## Development

Run `poetry install` to install dependencies.

If an environment variable specified in `.flaskenv` should be changed locally add a `.env` file with the corresponding variables set.

````{note}
First start only:

```bash
# create development database
poetry run flask create-db

# install requirements of plugins
poetry run flask install
```
````

Run the development server with

```bash
poetry run flask run
```

Start a redis instance in a docker container and start the worker process used for executing background tasks with

```bash
poetry run invoke start-broker
poetry run invoke worker  # use strg+c to stop worker
```


### Debugging with VSCode

There is a default launch configuration for vscode that should work on all platforms.
To use the configuration copy `default-launch.json` to `.vscode/launch.json`.
The `all` configuration starts the API and the worker process.
For code changes both debugging sessions must be restarted as they do not autoreload code!


### Trying out the Plugin-Runner

Start the plugin runner using the instructions above.

#### The API:

<http://localhost:5005/>

#### OpenAPI Documentation:

Configured in `qhana_plugin_runner/util/config/smorest_config.py`.

# only check generated requirements file:
poetry run flask install --dry-run
```

## Babel

```bash
# initial
poetry run pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -o messages.pot .
# create language
poetry run pybabel init -i messages.pot -d translations -l en
# compile translations to be used
poetry run pybabel compile -d translations
# extract updated strings
poetry run pybabel update -i messages.pot -d translations
```

## SQLAlchemy

```bash
# create dev db (this will NOT run migrations!)
poetry run flask create-db
# drop dev db
poetry run flask drop-db
```

## Migrations

ℹ️ Try to minimize the number of migrations and only create a new one when your changes are likely final.
Altenatively merge all your new migration into one before submitting a pull request.

If you have added new mapped dataclasses or modified existing ones, a migration script needs to be added.
This script updates the tables and columns of the database to match the mapped dataclasses.
To generate the migration script you need to do the following steps:

```bash
# delete the database
rm instance/qhana_plugin_runner.db
# upgrade the database to the latest migration
poetry run flask db upgrade
# generate a new migration script for the changes you made (always manually review the created migration!)
poetry run flask db migrate -m "changelog message"
# upgrade the database to reflect your changes
poetry run flask db upgrade
# if you need help with the commands
poetry run flask db --help
```

The migrations are handled by [flask-migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) which is based on [alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/index.html)

## Celery background tasks

Use invoke to run celery commands (e.g. to start the celery worker), as it will automatically apply `.flaskenv` and `.env` environment variables.

```bash
# Start a redis instance in a docker container with
poetry run invoke start-broker

# start a worker instance
poetry run invoke worker

# stop redis container
poetry run invoke stop-broker

# remove existing redis container (e.g. to set a new port)
poetry run invoke reset-broker
poetry run invoke start-broker --port="6379"

# get help for available commands
poetry run invoke --list
poetry run invoke worker --help
```


## Compiling the Documentation

```bash
poetry shell
cd docs
make html

# list all targets (only available after build!)
python -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx _build/html/objects.inv

# export/update requirements.txt from poetry dependencies (for readthedocs build)
poetry run invoke update-dependencies
```

Update the python source documentation

```bash
poetry run sphinx-apidoc --separate --force -o docs/source . ./tasks.py docs plugins migrations
rm docs/source/modules.rst  # delete modules file as this repository only contains one module
```


## Updating the Third-Party Licenses

```bash
# list all licenses
poetry run invoke list-licenses

# update licenses in repository
poetry run invoke update-dependencies
```

The third party licenses will be stored in the `qhana_plugin_runner/templates/licenses.html` file.


## Unit Tests

The unit tests use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html) and [hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

```bash
# Run all unit tests
poetry run pytest

# Run failed tests
poetry run pytest --last-failed  # see also --stepwise

# Run new tests
poetry run pytest --new-first

# List all tests
poetry run pytest --collect-only

# Run with hypothesis explanations
poetry run pytest --hypothesis-explain

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest -p pytest_cov --cov=qhana_plugin_runner

# With html report (open htmlcov/index.html in browser)
poetry run pytest -p pytest_cov --cov=qhana_plugin_runner --cov-report=html
```

## Docker

This repository contains a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` that can be used to run the project.
Pre-built Docker containers are also available via GitHub packages.


### Using the Docker Container

The docker container by default does not include any plugin.
There are three ways to include plugins:

 *  Build a new docker image with plugins.\
    Creating a new container with plugins and installing their dependencies at build time can improve the startup time of the container.
 *  Map in plugins with a bind mount.\
    Plugins can be mapped into the bare container from the local file system using a bind mount.
    This is useful for developing or testing plugins.
 *  Load plugins from a git repository.\
    The container can load plugins from git repositories specified in the `GIT_PLUGINS` environment variable.

    Specify a newline separated list of git repositories to load plugins from in the GIT_PLUGINS environment variable.
    Each line should contain a git URL following the same format as in requirements.txt used by pip.

    Examples:
    
    ```
    git+<<url to git repo>[@<branch/tag/commit hash>][#subdirectory=<directory in git repo holding the plugins>]
    git+https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/qhana-plugin-runner.git@main#subdirectory=/plugins
    ```

The plugin runner is configured to look for plugins in the folders `/app/plugins/`, `/app/git-plugins/` and `/app/extra-plugins/`.
Plugins loaded from git will be placed in the `git-plugins` folder.
Plugins mapped into the container from outside should use the `extra plugins` folder and plugins included in the container build should go into `plugins`.

The container starts in server mode by default.
For background tasks of plugins to work a container with the exact same plugins configured needs to be started in worker mode by setting `CONTAINER_MODE=worker`.
Currently the local file system is used as result store by default, meaning that all server and worker containers using the same set of plugins should share one file system under `/app/instance/`.
This restriction also applies if the default sqlite database is used.

For communication between server and worker containers, a redis or amqp broker need to be setup.
Server and worker containers with the same plugin configuration need to use the same broker.
The broker can be configured using the `BROKER_URL` and the `RESULT_BACKEND` environment variable.

The database to use can be configured using the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` environment variable.
SQLAlchemy is used which supports SQLite, Postgres and MariaDB/MySQL databases given that the [correct drivers](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html#supported-databases) are installed.
Database drivers can be installed by using plugins that specify that driver as an install requirement.

The default file store can be configured with the `DEFAULT_FILE_STORE` environment variable.
This defaults to `local_filesystem`.


### Running the Plugin-Runner with Docker Compose

Start the docker compose with:

```
docker-compose up
```

Delete the containers with:

```
docker-compose down
```

To also delete the volume containing the output files add the flag `-v`.

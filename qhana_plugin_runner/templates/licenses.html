HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE<br>==========================<br><br>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting<br>Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands<br>as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python&#x27;s<br>principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.<br><br>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for<br>National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)<br>in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the<br>software.<br><br>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to<br>BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same<br>year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became<br>Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see<br>https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization<br>created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.<br>Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.<br><br>All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for<br>the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python<br>releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes<br>the various releases.<br><br>    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-<br>                    from                                compatible?
